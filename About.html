    My name is Orestis Plevrakis. A few years ago, I completed my PhD from Princeton in theoretical computer science.
    However, during my PhD I became very interested in physics, and after completing the degree,
    I devoted myself to mathematical physics. I am currently in a self-studying phase,
    since my background in physics was limited. I plan to return to academia as a mathematical physicist.
    During my undergraduate years, I won a gold medal in the International Mathematics Competition for university students (IMC).

    When I am researching or studying mathematics, I am always looking for proofs that are intuitive and often visual.
    This is because I aim to understand the <em>reason</em> behind a mathematical phenomenon.
    Unfortunately, almost all mathematics textbooks do not have this attitude.
    There is a strong preference towards short proofs, even when these lack intuition and insight.
    As a result, it is common to have a central theorem whose textbook proof is short but obscure,
    <em>even though an intuitive proof exists in a published article</em>.
    This has a clear cost in the depth of students’ understanding.
    The purpose of this website is to feature such proofs.
