  <h1>Riemann Mapping Theorem</h1>
<p>
  The Riemann mapping theorem is one of the most central results in complex analysis. 
  However, the standard proof [1] lacks intuition. We will see an intuitive proof using ideas from topology and partial differential equations (PDEs). 
  No background in topology or PDEs is assumed. However, I will state and use (without proof) some theorems from topology that are intuitively obvious, 
  even though their proofs are nontrivial. I will refer to these theorems as <em>i.o.</em>, and in the 
  final section I will provide references for their proofs.
</p>


<p>
  To the hesitant student of mathematics: it is a standard practice among mathematicians to use established <em>i.o.</em> theorems,
  without having seen the proof. This is because they want to use their time to focus on the more conceptual and creative aspects of their work.
</p>


<p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> The reader is expected to be familiar with undergraduate complex analysis up to the Cauchy integral formula (e.g., Chapters 1 and 2.1–2.4 from [1]).
  
</p>

<p>We begin by introducing some definitions.</p>

<p><strong>Paths and loops.</strong> Let \(a>0\). A continuous function \( p:[0,a] \to \mathbb{C} \) is called a <em>continuous path</em>. If \(p\) is
  also injective, we call it <em>simple</em>. A continuous path \( p:[0,a] \to \mathbb{C} \) is called a <em>loop</em> if \( p(0) = p(a). \)
  A simple loop is also called a <em>Jordan curve</em>. Finally, regarding paths that go to infinity, we will only need the following type: 
  we say that \(p:(0,a) \to \mathbb{C}\) is a <em>simple continuous path that starts and ends at infinity</em> 
  if \(p\) is continuous and injective, and \( p(t) \to \infty \) as \( t \to 0 \) or \( t \to a \). 
</p>

<p>We will need the 
  following i.o. theorem about Jordan curves. If you are unaware of the term <em>connected component</em>, you can see [6].</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Theorem 1.</span>
  <span class="content">Let \( \ell:[0,a] \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \) be a Jordan curve, and let \( L := \ell([0,a]) \) denote its image. 
    Then the complement \( \mathbb{C} \setminus L \) consists of exactly two connected components, both of which are open.
    One of the components is bounded (called the <strong>interior</strong>, denoted \( A_\ell \)), 
    and the other is unbounded (called the <strong>exterior</strong>, denoted \( E_\ell \)).
     The curve \( L \) is the boundary of both components. Furthermore, the interior \( A_\ell \) and its closure \(A_\ell \cup L\)
      are both simply connected.</span>
</div>

<p>
Before stating the main theorem, we introduce one more concept. 
</p>
<p> <strong>Biholomorphisms.</strong> Let \(A, B\subseteq \mathbb{C}\) be open. If a holomorphism \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is a bijection, then we say that \(f\) is a <em>biholomorphism</em>.
   We will prove momentarily that if \(f\) is a biholomorphism, then its inverse is holomorphic. If there exists a biholomorphism between two open sets \(A, B\), then
  we say that \(A\) and \(B\) are <em>biholomorphic</em>. 
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Theorem 2 (Riemann mapping theorem).</span>
 <span class="content">
Let \( A \subseteq \mathbb{C} \) be non-empty, simply connected, and open. Suppose that \( A \) is not all of \( \mathbb{C} \).
Then there exists a biholomorphism from \( A \) onto the open unit disc \( D := \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < 1 \} \).
</span>

    Example of biholomorphism, as described by the Riemann mapping theorem.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  We will prove a slightly simplified version of Theorem 2. This is in order to focus on the main ideas, without being distracted by the 
  technical details needed for the fully general case. In [2], the authors generalize the approach we take here, to prove Theorem 2 in its
   full generality.
</p>

<p>
We prove Theorem 2 under the following assumption:
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Assumption.</span>
  <span class="content">The set \(A\) is either the interior of a Jordan curve (bounded case), 
    or it has a boundary that is a simple continuous path
     that starts and ends at infinity (unbounded case).
  </span>
</div>

<div class="image-container">
  <img id="inf-arg-prin" src="assumption.png" alt="Illustration of the Jordan curve and indicated directions" />
  <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; font-style: italic; color: #444; text-align: center; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    A bounded and an unbounded set satisfying our assumption.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Note that not all sets \(A\) in Theorem 2 satisfy our assumption, e.g., \(\mathbb{C}\setminus \{z\in \mathbb{C}: Re(z)\ge 0\}\).
</p>

<p>
  We will first do the proof for the bounded case. Then, we will prove the unbounded case by a simple reduction to the bounded one.

The bounded case
</h3>
<p>
  We will need some tools to attack the bounded case. The first tool is topological and complex-analytic. 
    It is called <em>the argument principle</em>, and it is covered in 
    <a href="argument-principle.html">this article</a> of mine. Even if you are familiar with it, 
    you will most probably benefit from that article, since the proof is fully visual. We will also need two applications of the argument principle, covered 
    <a href="applications-arg.html">here</a>. Make sure you have understood the material from these articles, before you continue. 
    
  </p>
  <p>
The third tool is the following theorem:
 </p>
<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Theorem 3.</span>
  <span class="content"> Let \( \ell:[0,a] \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \) be a Jordan curve, and let \( L := \ell([0,a]) \) denote its image and \(A\) its interior.
    Let \(g:L\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function. Then, there exists a unique function \(u: A \cup L \rightarrow \ \mathbb{R}\) that
     is continuous on \(A \cup L\), harmonic on \(A\), and equal to \(g\) on \(L\). 
  </span>
</div>
<p>
  In PDE terms, this theorem says that the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation, on a domain bounded by a Jordan curve, has a unique solution.
  Theorem 3 has a very intuitive proof using <em>probability theory</em>. Even though the full proof requires an advanced concept called <em>Brownian motion</em>,
  the core idea can be described in elementary terms — and the solution \( u \) can actually be constructed in a fully elementary way!
  I suggest you accept Theorem 3 as a fact for now and continue with the rest of the article. When you're done,
   if you're interested in understanding how Theorem 3 is proved, then:
</p>
<p>

<ul>
  <li>If you know the basics of Brownian motion, you can see the proof in [5].</li>
  <li>If you don’t know anything about Brownian motion, I encourage you to read my <a href="dirichlet-problem.html" style="text-underline-offset: 0.25em;">
  elementary exposition
</a> of the proof’s main idea.</li>
</ul>
</p>
  <p>
Now, let's move on with the proof of the bounded case.
  </p>
  

 

    
  
  


  <p> Without loss of generality, we assume that \(0\in A\) (otherwise we can just translate \(A\)). We will construct a biholomorphism 
    that sends zero to zero. First, we need a definition. Let \(\bar{S}\) denote the closure of a set \(S\).
  </p>


  <div class="theorem-box strong-biholo">
    <span class="label">Definition.</span>
    <span class="content">Let \( A, B \subseteq \mathbb{C} \) open sets. A function \( f : \bar{A} \to \bar{B} \) is a 
      <em>strong biholomorphism</em> if
      <div class="centered-list">
        <ol>
          <li>It is a continuous bijection.</li>
          <li>The restriction \( f|_A \) is a biholomorphism sending \( A \) onto \( B \).</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </span>
  </div>
<p>
  The first thing we will do is deduce some properties satisfied by all strong biholomorphisms \(f:\bar{A}\rightarrow \bar{D}\) with \(f(0)=0\). 
  These properties will give us insight into how to actually <em>construct</em> a biholomorphism from \(A\) onto \(D\) satisfying \(f(0)=0\). This function 
  will in fact be a strong biholomorphism, but we will not prove this here, as it is not needed for our theorem.
</p>


<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Claim 1.</span>
  <span class="content">Let \(f:\bar{A}\rightarrow \bar{D}\) be a strong biholomorphism with \(f(0)=0\). Then, there exists a holomorphic function 
    \(H:A\rightarrow \mathbb{C}\) such that \(f(z)=ze^{H(z)}\), for all \(z\in A\). Furthermore, the real part \(\text{Re}(H)\) can be continuously 
    extended to the closure \(\bar{A}\).
  </span>
</div>

<p>
  Again, it is possible to show that \(\text{Im}(H)\) can also be continuously extended to \(\bar{A}\), which implies that the identity \(f(z)=ze^{H(z)}\) holds on \(\bar{A}\).
  However, we won't need this fact and so we won't prove it here.
</p>

Proof
</h3>
<p>
  Let \( g : \bar{A} \to \mathbb{C} \) be defined as
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    g(z) := 
    \begin{cases}
      f(z)/z, &  z \in \bar{A} \setminus \{0\} \\
      f'(0), &  z = 0
    \end{cases}
  \]
</div>

<p>
  I claim that \( g \) is holomorphic on \( A \) and continuous on \( \bar{A} \).
  Indeed, locally around zero,
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    f(z) = f'(0)z + \frac{f''(0)}{2}z^2 + \dots
  \]
</div>

<p>
  Thus, locally around zero,
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    g(z) = f'(0) + \frac{f''(0)}{2}z + \dots
  \]
</div>

<p>
  So, \( g \) is holomorphic at zero, and clearly it is also holomorphic everywhere else on \( A \).
  The continuity of \( g \) at points of \( \partial A \) follows from the continuity of \( f \).
</p>

<p>
  Now, from Theorem 2 in 
  <a href="applications-arg.html">this article</a>,
  we know that \( f' \neq 0 \) on \( A \). Furthermore, since \( f \) is injective, we have \( g \neq 0 \) on \( \bar{A} \).
  This implies that there exists a holomorphic function \( H : A \to \mathbb{C} \) such that
  \( g(z) = e^{H(z)}, \) for all \( z \in A \). For a proof of this implication, you can see [4].
</p>

<p>
  Let \( u(z) \) and \( v(z) \) be the real and imaginary parts of \( H \). Since \( g \) is continuous on 
  \( \bar{A} \) and \( u(z) = \ln(|g(z)|) \), the function \( u(z) \) can be continuously extended on \( \bar{A} \).
  \(\ \square\)
</p>

<div style="height: 0.3rem;"></div>

<p>Continuing on the setting of Claim 1, we have that on the set \(A\), \(f(z)=ze^{u(z)+iv(z)}\), and so 

  <div class="math-display" id="eq1">
    \[
    |f(z)|=|z|e^{u(z)} 
    
    \]
  </div>
 <p> for all \(z\in A\). Since \(f\) and \(u\) are continuous on \(\bar{A}\), the above equality extends on \(\partial A\). Now, the crucial moment: since
  \(f\) is a strong biholomorphism, we have \(f(\partial A)=\partial D\). This property actually tells us <em>how to construct the function \(u\).</em>
  Indeed, since \(|f(z)|=1\) on \(\partial A\), we have that \(u(z)=-\log |z| \), for all \(z\in \partial A\). But \(u\) is the real part of a
  holomorphic function on \(A\), and thus it is <em>harmonic</em> on \(A\). This means that we can construct \(u\) by solving this Dirichlet problem!
</p>

font-weight: bold;
margin-top: 2.5rem;
margin-bottom: 1rem;

">
Construction of the imaginary part
</h3>
<p> 
  What about \(v\)? We can construct it by using \(u\)! Remember that these are coupled by the Cauchy-Riemann equations: \(u_x=v_y\) and \(u_y=-v_x\).
  Geometrically, this means that \(\nabla v\) is \(\nabla u\) rotated by \(90^\circ\) counter-clockwise. Since we have \(\nabla v\), we can get
  \(v\) up to an additive constant:
  <div class="math-display" id="eq1">
    \[
    v(x,y)=\int_\gamma \nabla v(s)\cdot ds + v(0)
    \]
  </div>
  where the above integral is the line integral of \(\nabla v\) along any piecewise-smooth curve \(\gamma\) that starts at zero, ends at \((x,y)\), and 
  lies entirely inside \(A\).
</p>

<p> Thus, <em>as long as there exists</em> a strong biholomorphism \(f:\bar{A}\rightarrow \bar{D}\) with \(f(0)=0\), this function \(f\) is uniquely determined
  up to a rotation (expressed by the constant \(v(0)\)).
</p>

font-size: 1.35rem;
font-weight: bold;
margin-top: 2.5rem;
margin-bottom: 1rem;
text-decoration: none;
">
The biholomorphism
</h3>
<p>
  We now use these insights to construct a biholomorphism from \( A \) onto \( D \). Let \( u \) be the unique function that is harmonic on \( A \), continuous on \( \bar{A} \), and equals \( -\log |z| \) on \( \partial A \). Let
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    v(x, y) := \int_\gamma (-u_y(s), u_x(s)) \cdot ds
  \]
</div>

<p>
  where \( \gamma \) is any piecewise-smooth curve that starts at the origin, ends at \( (x, y) \), and lies entirely inside \( A \).
  We will prove that the function \( f : A \to \mathbb{C} \) defined as
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    f(z) = z e^{u(z) + i v(z)}
  \]
</div>

<p>
  is holomorphic, sends \( A \) onto \(D \), and is injective. The fact that \( f \) is holomorphic is immediate, since \( u \) and \( v \) satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations (why?). We now prove the rest.
</p>

<h3 id= "Biholomorphism" style="

">
The boundary has all the information
</h3>

<p>
  To highlight the main idea, we first do the proof under the assumption that \( f \) can be continuously extended on \( \bar{A} \).
  We then drop this assumption by tweaking our argument. As I mentioned in <a href="applications-arg.html" style="text-underline-offset: 0.25em;"> this article</a>, whenever
  I say "argument principle", I mean its general version, given in Corollary 1 of that article.

<p>
  Let \( \ell : [0,a] \to \mathbb{C} \) be a positively oriented Jordan curve that parametrizes \( \partial A \).
  By the way we constructed \( u \), we have \( f(\partial A) \subseteq \partial D \), and so the loop \( f \circ \ell \) lies entirely on the unit circle.
  This implies that \( |f(z)| \leq 1 \) for all \( z \in A \). Indeed, if \( |f(z_0)| > 1 \) for some \( z_0 \in A \),
  then by the argument principle \( W(f \circ \ell, f(z_0)) \geq 1 \), a contradiction.
  Since \( f \) is an <a href="applications-arg.html" style="text-underline-offset: 0.25em;">
  open map
</a>, we have \( f(A) \subseteq D \).
</p>

<p>
  We need to show that \( f \) is onto and injective. We will see that these are also consequences of the argument principle.
  What is \( W(f \circ \ell, 0) \)? By the argument principle, it equals the number of roots of \( f \) in \( A \), counting multiplicities.
  Clearly, zero is the only root of \( f \). Combining this with
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    f'(0) = \lim_{z \to 0} \frac{f(z)}{z} = e^{u(0)} > 0
  \]
</div>

<p>
  we have \( W(f \circ \ell, 0) = 1 \). By Proposition 1 in 
  <a href="applications-arg.html">this article</a>, we have
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    W(f \circ \ell, q) = 1
  \]
</div>

<p>
  for all \( q \in D \). By the argument principle, for each \( q \in D \), there exists exactly one \( z \in A \) such that \( f(z) = q \).
  \(  \ \square\)

Dropping the continuity assumption
</h3>

Even if we don't assume that \(f\) can be continuously extended on \( \bar{A} \), we can still use the continuity of \(u\) on the boundary!
We first prove the following intuitively obvious proposition.

<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Proposition 1.</span>
  <span class="content"> For all \(\delta>0\), there exists a Jordan curve \(\ell_\delta:[0,a]\rightarrow \mathbb{C}\) that lies inside \(A,\) and is such that

  \( A \setminus \bar{D}_{z_0, \varepsilon} \). Remember that \( \bar{D}_{z_0, \varepsilon} \) denotes the closed disc centered at \( z_0 \) with radius \( \varepsilon \).


<p>
  Since \( [0,1] \times [0,1] \) is compact, the continuous function \( \gamma \) is in fact uniformly continuous.
  Thus, for any \( \delta > 0 \), there exists an \( \eta \in (0,1) \) such that
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    |\gamma(1 - \eta, t) - \gamma(1, t)| < \delta
  \]
</div>


  for all \( t \in [0,1] \). By setting 
  \( \ell_\delta(t) := \gamma(1 - \eta, t/a) \) for \( t \in [0,a] \), we are done. \(\ \square \)

We now explain why for all small enough \(\delta>0\), the loop \(f\circ \ell_\delta\) is very close to the unit circle.
Since \(u\) is continuous on the boundary, we can continuously extend \(|f|\) on \(\bar{A}\). 
Also, since \(\bar{A}\) is compact, \(|f|\) is uniformly continuous on \(\bar{A}\). This implies that for any \(\varepsilon>0\), there is a \(\delta_0>0\), such
that for all \(\delta\in (0,\delta_0)\), 
</p>

<div class="math-display">
  \[
    1-\varepsilon < |f\circ \ell_\delta (t)|<1+\varepsilon

  Using this fact, we can immediately adapt the proof we did under the continuity assumption. This adaptation is left as an exercise for the reader.

The unbounded case
</h3>
<p>
  Let \( A \) be an unbounded, simply connected, and open subset of \( \mathbb{C} \) that is not the whole \( \mathbb{C} \).
  Suppose the boundary of \( A \) is a simple continuous path that starts and ends at infinity. 
  We will construct a simple biholomorphism from \( A \) to a <em>bounded</em>, simply connected, and open subset of \( \mathbb{C} \),
  whose boundary is a Jordan curve. We proved that such a set is biholomorphic to \( D \). 
  Thus, we will be able to conclude that \( A \) is biholomorphic to \( D \).
</p>
<p>
  We will use the following i.o. theorem.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label">Theorem 4.</span>
  <span class="content"> Let \( p : (0, a) \to \mathbb{C} \) be a simple continuous path that starts and ends at infinity. Let \( A \) be an unbounded, 
    simply connected, and open set with boundary \( P := p((0, a)) \). Then, \( \mathbb{C} \setminus P \) has exactly two connected components: \( A \) and another set \(B\).
    The set \( B \) is also unbounded, simply connected, and open.
  </span>
</div>

<p>
  We apply this theorem to our setting. Without loss of generality, we assume that \(0\in B\) (otherwise, we can translate \(A\)). Let \(g(z):=1/z\). 
  By applying \(g\) to the path \(p\), we get a Jordan curve. This is formally expressed by defining \( \tilde{p} : [0, a] \to \mathbb{C} \) as follows:
</p>

  <div class="math-display">
    \[
      \tilde{p}(t) :=
      \begin{cases}
        g(p(t)), &  t \in (0, a) \\
        0, &  t = 0 \text{ or } t = a
      \end{cases}
    \]
  </div>
<p> Observe that \(\tilde{p}\) is indeed a Jordan curve. By proving the following claim, we complete the proof of the unbounded case.</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <span class="label"> Claim 2.</span>
  <span class="content"> The set \(g(A)\) is the interior of the Jordan curve \(\tilde{p}\).

  Remember that continuous functions send connected sets to connected sets. Also, holomorphic functions send open sets to open sets. Thus, \(g(A)\) and \(g(B\setminus\{0\})\) are both open and connected. They are also disjoint.
  Furthermore, observe that their union is \(\mathbb{C}\setminus \tilde{P}\), where \( \tilde{P}:=\tilde{p}([0,a]) \). Thus, \(g(A)\) and \(g(B\setminus\{0\})\) are the two connected components of \(\mathbb{C}\setminus \tilde{P}\) (why?). 
  Using Theorem 1 and the fact that \(g(B\setminus\{0\})\) is unbounded, we are done.

References for the i.o. theorems
</h3>

<p>
  For completeness, I provide references for proving the i.o. theorems used in this article, and also in the 
  <a href="argument-principle.html">one about the argument principle</a>. 
  As I said in the beginning, even though these theorems are intuitively obvious, their proofs are nontrivial. 
  Several of them follow from a central theorem in topology called <em>Jordan–Schoenflies</em> (JS) theorem [7].
</p>

<p>
  <strong>This article.</strong> Theorem 1 follows from JS (even though the first part is the simplest 
  <em>Jordan curve theorem</em>). Theorem 4 follows from Theorem 1, by applying the inversion idea that we used for the unbounded case.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Argument principle article.</strong> Theorem 1 is proved using a topological concept called 
  <em>covering maps</em> (see Chapter 9 of [8]). Theorem 4 also follows immediately from the techniques of that chapter, 
  and it is the simplest example of a topological fact called <em>Hopf’s Degree Theorem</em> that is valid in any number of dimensions. 
  Now, about Theorem 2, its first part is proven in Section 65 of [8], and the second part follows from the 
  <em>Annulus theorem</em> [9], which is a consequence of JS. Finally, Theorem 5 follows from JS.
